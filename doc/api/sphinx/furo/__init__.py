    # Hello human in the future! This next block of code needs a bit of a story, and
    # if you're going to touch it, remember to update the number above (or remove this
    # comment entirely).
    #
    # Hopefully, you know that Sphinx allows extensions and themes to add configuration
    # values via `app.add_config_value`. This usually lets users set those values from
    # `conf.py` while allowing the extension to read from it and utilise that information.
    # As any reasonable person who's written a Sphinx extension before, you would
    # expect the following to work:
    #
    #     dark_style = app.config.pygments_dark_style
    #
    # Turns out, no. How dare you expect things to just work!? That stuff just returns
    # the default value provided when calling `app.add_config_value`. Yes, even if you
    # set it in `conf.py`. Why? Good question. :)
    #
    # The logic in Sphinx literally looks it up in the same mapping as what was
    # manipulated by `add_config_value`, and there's no other spot where that value
    # gets manipulated. I spent a bunch of time debugging how that class works, and...
    # yea, I can't figure it out. There's multiple mappings floating around and bunch
    # of manipulation being done for all kinds of things.
    #
    # The only place on the config object where I was able to find the user-provided
    # value from `conf.py` is a private variable `self._raw_config`. Those values are
    # supposed to get added to self.__dict__[...], and generally be accessible through
    # the object's custom `__getattr__`.
    #
    # Anyway, after giving up on figuring out how to file a PR to fix this upstream, I
    # started looking for hacky ways to get this without reaching into private
    # variables. That quest led to a very simple conclusion: no, you can't do that.
    #
    # So, here we are: with the only option being to reach into the guts of the beast,
    # and pull out the specific thing that's needed. This is obviously fragile though,
    # so this is written with the assumption that any changes to Sphinx's config
    # object's internals would correspond to the originally expected behaviour working.
    # This is so that when any of Sphinx's internals change, this logic would basically
    # fall back to the original behaviour and also print a warning, so that hopefully
    # someone will report this. Maybe it'll all be fixed, and I can remove this whole
    # hack and this giant comment.
