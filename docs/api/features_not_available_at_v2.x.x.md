# Features not available in the current version

## Mirror/Flip/Rotate frames inside SDK or device

In order to reduce coupling and improve performance, OrbbecSDK v2.x will no longer support outputting data frames after mirror/flip/rotate processing, but users can freely handle mirror/flip/rotate in their application by explicitly calling the frame processing filters.

## Recording and playback function

The recording and playback function is temporarily unavaiable and will soon be redesigned and released in a future version of OrbbecSDK v2.x. 

## Firmware upgrade and OrbbecViewer OTA function

The firmware upgrade function is temporarily unavaiable and will soon be redesigned and released in a future version of OrbbecSDK v2.x. Current users need to use OrbbecSDK v1.x and tools based on OrbbecSDK v1.x to upgrade the firmware.
